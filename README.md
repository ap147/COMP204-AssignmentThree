COMP204-16B / COMP242-16B Assignment 3
======================================

Due on **Sunday, 14th August at 11:30pm**.


Experimenting with a big Java Package â€“ JavaFX
==============================================

The goal of this exercise is learn about the JavaFX system for building user interfaces.
JavaFX is the recommended library for making user interfaces in desktop applications with 
Java 8 (the current version of the Java language and development system).

JavaFX is described in the [documentation supplied by Oracle, found here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/).

This assignment is comprised of 3 parts:
 1. Writing a basic "Hello World" JavaFX program guided by documentation
 2. Creating a basic form using JavaFX guided by documentation
 3. Beginning a more complex project that leverages what you learned in the first two parts


Preamble
========

1. Fork this repository using the button at the top of the page.
  * Set the visibility level of the project to Private.
2. Clone your new repository to your computer using Git.


Task 1
======

To begin, open up the JavaFX\_Hello\_World project with your IDE and the [JavaFX Hello World tutorial, found here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/hello_world.htm) in a browser.

* Work through the Hello World code and implement it in your project. Resist the temptation to copy and paste the code from the tutorial page, it will help to type it out by hand.
* Come up with three questions you have about your solution and detail them below.
* Modify your solution to attempt to answer your questions. Update your questions below to indicate how you went about answering the question and what the answer was.

Task 1 Questions
----------------

To be completed by the student.


Task 2
======

To begin, open up the JavaFX\_Form\_Design project with your IDE and the [JavaFX Form Creation tutorial, found here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/form.htm) in a browser.

* Work through the tutorial and implement it in your project. Resist the temptation to copy and paste the code from the tutorial page, it will help to type it out by hand.
* Come up with three questions you have about your solution and detail them below. **These questions should differ from those used in Task 1**.
* Modify your solution to attempt to answer your questions. Update your questions below to indicate how you went about answering the question and what the answer was.

Task 2 Questions
----------------

To be completed by the student.


Task 3
======

You are tasked with writing an application that takes a list of 3 products, quantities and unit costs; and produces a reciept reflecting that information.  
In addition, the generated reciept prices should be editable. A mockup of what you will be building is shown below.

![Example interface](images/project.PNG)

You will need to split the window into halves. On the left-hand side you should
have 3 rows of 3 input fields. These fields should allow for setting a product
name, quantity and unit cost for each row. On the right you should have a 
non-editable representation of each row's product name and quantity, and an 
editable field that contains the total cost for that row.  Also on the 
right-hand side there should be a non-editable total field that contains the sum
of the totals on the right side.
